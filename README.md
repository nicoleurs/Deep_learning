# AT&T Spam Detector

## Project description
One of the main pain point that AT&T users are facing is constant exposure to SPAM messages.

AT&T has been able to manually flag spam messages for a time, but they are looking for an automated way of detecting spams to protect their users.

## Objectives
The main objective is to build a spam detector, that can automatically flag spams as they come based solely on the sms' content.

## Usage

#### AT_T.ipynb
##### Contains all the preprocessing and training for the models as well as performance assessment

#### Logs folder
##### Includes vectors and metadata of the first custom embedding model for visualization
